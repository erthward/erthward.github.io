**Landscapes are complex, both in space *and* in time.** In ecological science we can often get away with swallowing that temporal complexity into long-term averages and assumptions of stationarity (that is, assumptions that ecological conditions are static). We can often away with this -- but not always! Sometimes interesting and important dynamics hide behind our simplifying assumptions about time. I like to dive head-first into these blind spots, asking how complex space-time patterns in the environment structure the ecological and evolutionary processes that generate, distribute, and maintain biodiversity?

**Landscape are changing at an historic pace.** When viewed from a grand geological perspective, human activity has ramped up with mind-bending pace and extent. We have exploded onto the scence. The evidence of this accelerating change is mounting, even over recent decades. This is our undeniable new reality. And it raises important questions and complications for many of our field's fiindings and theories, based as they are on assumptions of stationarity. This requires us to do the hard work of updating our field: adopting non-stationarity as the new norm, determining whether and how this changes our understanding of how nature works, and improving our ability to manage and conserve nature on a rapidly changing planet. I am contributing to this effort through both theoretical work and a wide variety of applied science projects.

**I'm a... *`sigh`*... data scientist.** While I have no aversion to fieldwork (in fact, I quite love it!), I have often found it unnecessary. This is because many of the sorts of questions I tend to wonder about can often be approached using the rich diversity of data that I already have at hand. This includes data that can be 'found' (i.e., public databases, remote sensing imagery, literature-locked measurements, and other open resources) as well as data that can 'made' (i.e., simulated -- which enables geographic and temporal coverage, biological complexity, and statistical replication *in silico* that far exceed what is practical *in carbone*). One of the big challenges in leveraging these data to answer important scientific questions lies in mastering the computational tools required to wrangle, process, analyze, and visualize them. Thus (to my occasional chagrin) I've wound up developing expertise in environmental data science. Lucky for me, I like playing with computers. :) Unlucky for me, computers don't like playing outside. :(

**Really though, I'm an intellectual nomad in a specialized world.** Throughout my life, I have pursued broad training and experience in ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics, conservation, geography, statistics, computer science, environmental policy, agriculture, and sustainable development. A profound love for nature and science is the throughline. I try to read widely, think freely, and use creative problem-solving to chase big, imaginitive, odd, and intriguingly complex ideas, wherever they might lead me. My work is motivated, in equal parts, by a passion for natural history, a compulsion toward abstract reasoning and quantitative theory, an ethical commitment to human-centered conservation, and an inborn desire to teach and share.
